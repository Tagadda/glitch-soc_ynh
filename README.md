## Overview

`glitch-soc` is a friendly [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) of the open-source social media software [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), with the aim of providing additional features at the risk of potentially less stable software.

###  What's different from Mastodon?

`glitch-soc` adds a number of experimental features to Mastodon, such as:

- Media improvements
  - Images inside the CW spoiler
  - fullwidth images
  - scaling options
- Formatted toots
- Reply selection in lists
- Filter improvements
- Highlighting of misleading links
- Hiding follower count
- An app settings modal
- Collapsible toots
- Toot visibility icons
- Local-only toots
- Threaded mode
- `data-*` attributes on statuses
- Advanced theming via flavours+skins
- Doodle

See more [on the documentation](https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/).
